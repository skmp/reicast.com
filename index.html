  <h1>Reicast</h1>
  <p>Reicast was a dreamcast emulator (2013 - 2021), derived from the nullDCe codebase</p>
  <p>Reicast was maintained by Stefanos Kornilios Mitsis Poiitidis, and received several contributions from other developers over its lifetime</p>
  <p>Reicast is now discontinued, due to large part on the libretro drama/fork of 2019, general community toxicity around emudev and open source, lack of interested developers and a wish on skmp's part to move on with other projects in his life.</p>
  <p>We hope we brought you back fond memories, and/or that you got to experience the magic of the Dreamcast through this project :)</p>
  <p>There are several other actively developed Dreamcast Emulation projects, with at least one of them a derivative of Reicast, which you can use</p>
  <p>Cheers, ~skmp</p>

  <h1 class="page-heading">What is this?</h1>

  <p>Reicast is a Sega Dreamcast emulator. It's an app that allows you to play your Dreamcast games on your computer or android phone. We've even baked in some magic to make things looks prettier than they did on the Dreamcast. Of course, not all games work, and the ones that do often have glitches</p>

  <p>Reicast primarily aims for speed and to run on android. It is derived from the nullDC codebase. We work on it in our spare time, because we love working on complicated, headache-inducing projects. Development traces back to late 2003 and has been largely non-continuous.</p>

  <p>Naturally, there are many other Dreamcast emulation projects, each with its own goals and priorities. Here's a non-exaustive list: Makaron, Demul, Redream, nullDC. If Reicast doesn't work for you, you may want to check these out.</p>
